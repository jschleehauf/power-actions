# power-actions
PowerShell script that remotely runs actions in Configuration Manager.

Useful for IT professionals to automate a tedious task. 
This runs all the actions. If you want to run just one or select actions, this may
not be for you. Although, running all the actions may be a reasonable cost if you need
to run remotely.
